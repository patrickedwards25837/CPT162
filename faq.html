			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<p>We know you have some questions, so hopefully we can have them already answered here. </p>
			<h2>Do you allow children? </h2>
			<p>Yes, we allow children as we are proud to be a family-friendly establishment. However, we must ask for the safety and enjoyment of all our customers that you always keep your children under direct and immediate supervision. We do try to keep some board games and other activities available. </p>
			<h2>Do you allow dogs? </h2>
			<p>Of course! We are extremely dog friendly at this point. We have many of our own of which you may see one of the many wandering around. Now while we would like to remain dog friendly for as long as possible, this is solely dependent on you being responsible pet-parents. </p>
			<p> If you do plan on bringing along your furry friend, please be respectful of our other customers by only doing so if you already know that your dog is well-behaved in this kind of environment. We are situated in a warehouse, so it could be quite loud at times seeing as we are kid friendly, there could be other dogs around, and there could be quite the crowd. The way our space is set up, our tap room area is not separated from our production area by anything but a chain, so there may often be loud noises that could end up spooking fido. </p>
			<p> We must insist that you keep your dog on a leash at all times and please clean up after them.
			<h2>Do you have and gluten free options? </h2>
			<p>Yes! We have our own handcrafted cider and mead that we rotate regularly! </p>
			<h2>Do you offer brewery tours? </h2>
			<p> Yes, we do! All you need to do is just ask one of our bartenders about a tour. </p>
			<h2>Do you serve food? </h2>
			<p>We do not have our own kitchen currently, but we are planning to add one soon. We have a rotating food truck schedule in the meantime. </p>
