				<h2>Patrick</h2>
				<h3> Co-Head Brewer/Owner</h3>
				<p>Originally from Beaufort, NC, Patrick moved to the Charleston area in 2010 as an attempt to leave his small town in search of better opportunity. In doing so, he met his now wife Leigh while working at a Ruby Tuesday in North Charleston. He went on to earn a degree from Trident Tech in the field of Computer Programming. Patrick started homebrewing back in 2014 and ended up discovering it was one of the most enjoyable things he had ever done.  He has made many friends since his move to the Charleston area, but he and Alex share the passion for brewing that made Zookeeper Brewing what is it today. </p>

				<h2>Leigh</h2>
				<h3>Co-Owner</h3>
				<p> Originally from Greenwood, SC, Leigh moved to Charleston looking for a change of scenery. She ended up meeting her now husband Patrick while they both worked at a Ruby Tuesday together in North Charleston, where they formed many friendships that last to this day. After a few years, Patrick convinced her to finally try and get out of the food and bev industry and she dove head first into the veterinarian field as a surgical vet tech at Charleston Animal Society where she stayed for several years before deciding to dive into the brewery game. She started out as a first-rate taste tester for Pat and Alex and in the end coming aboard to help out with their adventure. </p>
