			<h1>Our Story </h1>
			<p>It all started with our wives, Leigh and Kelsey, who met as veterinarian surgical technicians at Charleston Animal Society became fast friends and now are inseparable. With them both married and looking for reasons to hang out more, they decided they needed to get their husbands to try and become friends. And so the “playdates” began and in doing so Alex and Patrick discovered each other’s passion for brewing their own beer, thus becoming friends in the process. At the time Alex was still in the United States Navy and Patrick was working in the food industry while going to school to pursue a degree in computer technology, so it took time to get the brews just they way they wanted. What started out as a fun hobby for the both of them ended up turning into something much more as time went on and after much trial and error on their part. They perfected some recipes they thought were too good not to share and thus the idea of a brewery began to form. They continued to master their craft as they learned and experimented with new brews and ingredient combinations. As both couples each had a zoo of animals at home, after much deliberation it was decided that we should name the brewery in some way to acknowledge our wives’ passion for animals and our love of our furry children and thus we dubbed ourselves as Zookeepers. And now here we are a few years later, finally ready to share our beer with our fellow zookeepers. </p>
